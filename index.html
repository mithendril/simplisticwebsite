        <h1>This is a simplistic website.</h1>
        <p>And it's perfect.</p>
    </header>
<!-- Premier paragraphe -->
    <h2>Seriously, what else do you want?</h2>
    <p>You probably build websites and think your is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong. Let me describe your perfect website:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li>Fits on all your screens</li>
        <li>Looks the same in all your browsers</li>
        <li>The simplistic's accessible to every peoples that visits your site</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Well guess what :</h3>
    <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this. It's a simplistic website. Why do you need to animate a trendy banner flag when I hover over that useless thing? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your site. But nobody care about that.</p>
    <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>

<!-- Second paragraphe -->
    <h2>It's lightweight</h2>
    <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the  background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site?</p>

<!-- Troisième paragraphe -->
    <h2>It's responsive</h2>
    <p>You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a Tamagotchi.</p>

<!-- Quatrième paragraphe -->
    <h2>It works</h2>
    <p>Look at this. You can read it ... that is, if you can read. It makes sense. It's using HTML5 tags. That's semantics.</p>
    <p>It has content on the screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
    <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this in IE6. And see !</p>

<!-- Cinquième paragraphe -->
    <h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>
    <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no idea what a website is. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's beautiful.</p>
    <h3>Yes, this is satire</h3>
    <p>I'm not actually saying your site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them.</p>

<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>From the philosophies expressed (poorly) above, <a href="http://txti.es/">txti</a> was created. You should try it today to make your own simplistic websites.</p>
